# Jobteaser - Card Filter Test

Welcome to the repository for my Jobteaser Card Filter test.

Simply clone the git repo and run **npm install** or **yarn**, depending on which package manager you prefer to use, and then **npm start** or **yarn start** to run the project in the browser.

It will normally run on localhost port 3000 unless already occupied, in which case you will be asked to choose an alternative port in the terminal.

This repo was left as public to allow you to review the code.

I took the opportunity of this test to experiment get hands on with **Redux** from scratch.

This was also my first time getting hands on with some development tools such as **ESlint**, **Prettier** and more.

## Enjoy!
